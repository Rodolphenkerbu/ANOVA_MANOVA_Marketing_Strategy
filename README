# ANOVA and MANOVA Analysis of Marketing data

This repository contains an R Markdown report and supporting code for analyzing customer engagement across different marketing channels using ANOVA and MANOVA techniques.

This project implements one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and MANOVA in R to analyze customer engagement across marketing channels. Using a dataset of 600 records, the study tests whether Email, Radio, 

Social Media, and TV differ in their impact on Purchases, Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Time Spent. Statistical assumptions were evaluated using Levene’s, Shapiro-Wilk, and Box’s M tests, and results were 

visualized through boxplots, interaction plots, and canonical variates plots. The report includes formal hypothesis framing, embedded diagnostics, and a discussion of future modeling directions including 

PERMANOVA and machine learning.
